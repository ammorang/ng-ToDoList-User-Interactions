ANGULAR TODO LIST LAB PART 2
Task: Add interactivity to the todo list.

What does the application do?
1. User can add items to the bottom of the list.
2. User can filter the list.
3. User can remove items from the list, by clicking the “x”.
4. User can mark items complete by clicking the “complete” button.

Build Specifications:
1. Submitting the form calls a function named addTask that adds a new todo to the array with complete set to false.
2. Clicking the “x” on an item executes a function named removeTask that removes that item from the array.
3. Clicking the “complete” button executes a function named completeTask that sets the task’s completed property to true.
4. The text input at the top is for filtering. Typing into the filter text input uses an Angular filter to filter the items shown.
